    "The paper on which we've based our project on uses similarity scores to word and character n-gram models as the features for subsequent classification. Let us embark too on construction of such models. However, other literature has shown that for character n-grams, increasing n seems to enhance classifcation. Thus, we will construct models for up to 10 n-gram models.\n",

    "Note, a problem with (i) is that construction of n-grams suffers from combinatorial explosion. This is problematic for our purposes as we have no access to a computer with more than 8 GB RAM. To prevent this combinatorial explosion, we prevent construction of higher order n-grams that do not meet a lower threshold `lowerfreqlimit`. Grams with counts equal to 1 do not contribute to the similarity score. Hence, for a strict replication of Al-'Rfou `lowerfreqlimit` should be set to 1. Where we run into trouble processing data we take the liberty to increase this parameter a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that increasing this parameter will result in loss of information as it will not record misspellings, which may be indicative of non-native written text. However, note that the character n-grams capture typical non-native speaker mistakes, such that this loss of information is limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the implementation of pruned_language_distribution may seem not very efficient, as it has to check for each n-gram if the sum of the two (n-1) grams it contains exceeds `lowerfreqlimit`. We provide a little benchmark in the appendix to compare `pruned_language_distribution` againt `language_distribution` where all bigrams are exhaustively constructed. "

Note that accuracy of course depends on the fold on the training and testing data. For another fold, we found accuracy of 73.0%. Let us investigate if we can bump up this accuracy by parameter tuning through grid search. We will also try to improve this accuracy by using a non-linear kernel. Such a non-linear kernel may make sense as it is not guaranteed at all that the two classes are linearly separable. There is also the consideration of scaling. We did not apply it here as Al-Rfou does not seem to apply it, but it is generally thought to be a good idea for SVMs when one starts working with kernels.\n",

In retrospect, this is not entirely unexpected as increasing the parameter C is a means to increase robustness by lowering the bias of the classifier.

Although historically considered a nuisance parameter, it has become clear that C critically determines whether the classifier will overfit. Let us therefore do a grid search for an appropriate C. Cross-validation will not be pursued, since (i) it takes too long and we have ample data and (ii) 5-fold cross-validation performed in a previous version of this script showed the s.e. on MSE is very small (approx. two order of magnitudes smaller than the MSE itself).\n"
